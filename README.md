# Semantic-Analysis-and-Word-Vector-Application-for-Stock-Market-Forecast
Introduction:  This study blends Chinese semantic analysis, Word2vec, and machine learning for stock market prediction. By extracting insights from textual data using NLP, understanding contextual relationships through word vectors, and employing supervised learning, our approach aims to enhance forecasting accuracy in the dynamic financial landscape.

There are 2 different documents which should be prepared in advance. 
stock_data: An Excel spreadsheet ended up with .xlsx with different sheets for data in different years.
news: A csv spreadsheet ended up with .csv.

**1. Abstract:**
This project aims to predict stock price trends based on news information using machine learning techniques. Specifically, natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as Word2Vec are employed to convert news text into vector representations, capturing semantic similarities between words. Classification models including Random Forest and Logistic Regression are utilized to predict whether stock prices will rise or fall. The model's performance is evaluated through training and testing, and metrics such as profit and hit rate are used to assess prediction effectiveness.

**2. Purpose:**
The main objective is to build a model capable of predicting stock price trends, assisting investors in making more informed investment decisions. By analyzing news information and applying machine learning techniques, the aim is to enhance understanding of the stock market and improve prediction accuracy.

**3. Techniques Used:**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Utilizing Word2Vec to convert news text into vector representations, capturing semantic features.
- **Classification Models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression):** Applying Random Forest and Logistic Regression models for binary classification to predict stock price trends.
- **Metrics such as Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Recall, Precision:** Used to evaluate model performance and prediction effectiveness.

**4. Process:**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes tasks such as converting news text, feature engineering, etc.
- **Model Building:** Using Word2Vec and classification models like Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, recall, etc.
